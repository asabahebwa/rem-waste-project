# React + TypeScript + Vite

I created this demo with React + TypeScript + Vite and installed Tailwind CSS as a vite plugin. This is the most is the most seamless way to integrate Tailwind CSS with frameworks like React so I added the @tailwindcss/vite plugin to the vite configuration.

I retrieved skip data from the API using built-in fetch.
