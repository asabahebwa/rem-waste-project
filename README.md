# React + TypeScript + Vite

I created this demo with React + TypeScript + Vite and installed Tailwind CSS as a vite plugin. This is the most seamless way to integrate Tailwind CSS with frameworks like React so I added the @tailwindcss/vite plugin to the vite configuration.

I retrieved skip data from the API using built-in fetch.

## Testing

I added unit tests using React Testing Library and Jest. Use `npm run test` to run tests normally in the terminal. To run tests in watch mode, run `npm run test:watch`, to see the code coverage, you need to run `npm run test:coverage`.
